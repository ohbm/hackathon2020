## Integration
How would your project integrate a physicist/imager/clinician/psychologist/computational scientist/maker/artist/lawyer as collaborator?

You can check the Mozilla Open Leadership material on [personas](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/bring-on-contributors-using-personas-and-pathways/) and [contribution guidelines](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/write-contributor-guidelines/).  

Try to define intermediate goals (milestones).  

## Preparation material
Provide links to preparation material/online tutorials. You can, for example, have a look at the [OHBM  list of online tutorials](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2019/blob/master/Tutorial_Resources.md).

## Link to your GitHub repo
[YourGitHubRepo](https://github.com/yourUserName/yourRepo) with a [REAME.md](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/) containing:
* project idea and context;
* installation guidelines if applicable;  
* links to further reading/tutorials;

## Communication
Link to the communication channel for your project.

You can, for example, create a mattermost channel for your project inside the [brainhack mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/), and include a Mattermost badge <a href="https://mattermost.brainhack.org/"><img src="http://www.mattermost.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/logoHorizontal.png" width=100px /> to invite people to the brainhack mattermost, where they can then find and join your channel.

Or create a community on [gitter](https://gitter.im/) and link to the chat by including a Gitter badge linking to your community
