# Project monitor: role description

The [OHBM Brainhack 2020](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2020/) will gather researchers throughout the world for an online hackathon June 16-18, organized around 3 hubs: 'Asia and Pacific', 'Africa, Middle East and Europe' and the 'Americas'.

**Project monitors** play an essential role in guiding project leads to comply with Brainhack project guidelines and set minimal documentation to make their project more welcoming to new members. 

**Description**
A monitor is a member of the open science neuroimaging community who:
 - is familiar with online tools for collaborative projects: including Brainhack mattermost and jitsi.
 - feels comfortable welcoming project leads and sharing information on how to use these tools as needed

As a monitor, there is no need for you to have expertise in the project you are assigned to. 

**Expectations**
1. Help develop and maintain a welcoming environment in the OHBM Brainhack
1. Select 2-5 projects to monitor during the submission process and the Brainhack
2. Be available to reply to any requests from project lead as they go through the project submission checklist.
3. Check the projects for compliance with the hackathon submission checklist
4. Jointly with the team of project monitors, help identify possible merges across projects and hubs. We would like to target a total of 20-25 projects per hub maximum to keep project pitches under 1.5 hours.
5. Once projects have been approved, help advertise them on the website and social media in relation with the communication team.
6. During the Brainhack, interact daily with the project lead on Github to 1- get feedback on the event, 2- document progress and 3- gather any feedback or specific need for help regarding the project. Communicate feedback or any identified issues with hub leads as needed.

**Estimated time**: max 30 minutes per project during project submission and max 15 minutes per project / day during Brainhack.

**Join the team!** Thank you so much for willing to help. In order to sign up as a project monitor, please fill in this form (TODO!).
