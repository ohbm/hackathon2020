  details: "Recent work in neuroscience and other fields has identified a bias in citation practices such that papers from women
  and other minorities are under-cited relative to the number of such papers in the field. For this project, we seek to further the
  development of two tools to help researchers combat these trends in their own citation practices. The first tool is an interactive jupyter
  notebook that provides probabilistic gender break down of first and last authors from a bibliography in a bibtex file. The second is a Google
  Chrome extension that displays the probabilistic gender of first and last authors of papers on the common search engines Google Scholar and PubMed.

  title: "Vector Embeddings of Brain Dynamics"
  image: vectorbraindynamics.png
  details: "Whereas we can build time-varying functional connectivity (TVFC) graphs
  easily and efficiently using instantaneous wavelet coherence. And whereas we can
  compare TVFC graphs using a host of graph-graph metrics---from simple edge-wise
  overlap, to more robust methods from topological data analysis. The capacity to
  understand how TVFC states compare among volunteers is limited by the transductive
  nature of state-of-the-art manifold embedding algorithms such as tSNE and UMAP.
  Transductive methods tend to overweight the temporal adjacencies of graph-graph
  distances measured within single volunteers, and thereby ignore the large-scale
  graph-graph similarities measured across volunteers. To address this issue, this
  project aims to build vector embeddings of several TVFC graph-graph distances using
  a Siamese neural network.

  title: "Tutorial for cross decomposition algorithms (e.g. CCA, PLS) in Python"
  image: decompositionalgorithms.gif
  details: "Cross decomposition algorithms look for the relations between two (or more) blocks of variables.
  These methods are particularly used in neuroimaging to analyze associations between physiological/behavioral variables and brain structure/function.
  Between unsupervised and supervised modeling, this family of algorithms has many members (e.g. CCA, PLS regression, PLS canonical, PLS-PM, etc.)
  and many approaches are possible to validate the trained model (e.g. cross validation, bootstrapping, permutation test, etc.).
  In this project, I propose to write several Python tutorials to help the application and interpretation of these models in practice.

  image: whatever.png
  details: "Children with ADHD, PTSD or generalized anxiety benefit from
  neurofeedback from an EEG while performing a task (e.g. focusing, calming) to develop cognitive skills
  that can assist them to cope and perform better throughout life. Some problems with this training
  a) the tools need to be easy to access and setup (e.g. wearable); b) the feedback should be engaging
  and ideally involving multiple senses (e.g. visual, auditory, 3D, aromas); and c) the feedback should
  be based on both brain waves (EEG) and other indicators (e.g. body motion, heart rate, breathing rate)
  to provide richer self-understanding.
  <br>Problem: Develop an app for use with a wearable neurofeedback system (e.g. Muse, Emotiv, OpenBCI)
  that provides richer environmental feedback and/or sensing to better serve the ADHD, PTSD or
  generalized anxiety pediatric populations.

  title: "Bidsme -- bidsifier for multimodal datasets"
  image: whatever.png
  details: "One of the great ideas behind BIDS is unification of various modalities in the same dataset, sharing common metadata and providing
  a self-sufficient dataset ready to analyse. However various bidsificators target only one or two modalities. Bidsme project has been developed to provide a bidsificator
  as universal as possible, both in modalities and data formats. The project is based on two main ideas: <br>  1. everything that is laboratory-depending (log files, events,
  demographic info, psychological assessments, format conversions) must be treated via plugins. <br>  2. Data treated in object-oriented way: master class do the bidsifications,
  modality sub-class defines the BIDS-related parameters (entities, JSON fields etc...), data-format sub-sub-class implements how to read metadata. <br>Using this approach it
  is possible to integrate a new modality from scratch in one week, and fully create plugins for a given dataset in few days.

  details: "Emerging evidence suggests the outstanding utility of multimodal neuroimaging data in predicting individual variation in age and cognition.
  However, it is unclear whether the predictive utility of such measures is a global effect or is consistently attributed to certain localized patterns
  of brain structure and connectivity. <br>This project aims to evaluate and develop an analysis framework for optimal performance of age and behavior
  (e.g. fluid intelligence) prediction using measures of brain structure and connectivity. The goal is to achieve both overall high prediction accuracy
  in cross-validated samples and high consistency in the estimated predictors (e.g. regions/connections) if possible. A secondary aim of the project is
  to investigate the potential markers of sub-clinical cognitive decline through simultaneous prediction of age and cognition in a healthy adult cohort.

  title: "Virtual Neuro Machine (VNM)"
  image: virtualneuromachine.png
  details: "With the advent of container technology, cumbersome virtual machines
  have been reduced to a single container file that can be easily run on multiple-environments. Containers
  can be run both interactively (e.g., within a Virtual Machine on the cloud) and in batch processing
  (e.g., on HPC), thus contributing to reproducibility across stages of the analysis. The goal of this
  project is to generate a 'virtual neuro machine' container, i.e. a large container that includes most
  popular neuroimaging tools, and can be used as a stand-alone VM. Although tools to generate neuroimaging
  software containers are already in place (e.g., neurodocker), continued maintenance of such a large
  container with complex library dependencies requires in-built testing capabilities, and especially so,
  of included GUI applications. This project will bring together people working on different environments
  and using different neuroimaging tools, in order to 1) build a working container with the newest software
  versions available in June 2020, 2) develop in-built testing capabilities, to facilitate future container
  upgrades, 3) develop a standard 'home screen' for the container, to provide common interface across host
  environments.

  title: "Evaluating the pipeline stability though the libmath fuzzy environment"
  image: fuzzy.png
  details: "Data analysis pipelines are known to be impacted by the operating system updates, presumably due to the creation,
  propagation, and amplification of numerical noises. These are uncontrolled noises that are originated in updates of low-level libraries
  by third-party developers. In practice, these numerical instabilities are caused by truncation and round-off errors due to the precision
  limitation of the floating-point arithmetic. The finite precision of the floating-point numbers leads to represent an approximation of
  a real number that may be different on the computers with various precision formats. A possible method to investigate operating system related
  effects more comprehensively is to introduce controlled numerical perturbations in the math library functions (libmath), which could be done by
  introducing noise in floating-point computations through Monte-Carlo Arithmetic (MCA) using the Verificarlo tool. <br>For the hackathon we'll be
  looking to test the validity of the instrumented libmath library functions and also evaluate the stability of the existing neuroimaging pipelines.

  title: "Integration of EEG inside Connectome-Mapper 3"
  image: cmp3.png
  details: "Flexible pipelines for both diffusion MRI and functional MRI have been implemented in different software such as the <a href=https://connectome-mapper-3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>Connectome Mapper 3</a>, an open-source pipeline software, released as a BIDS App, for mapping hierarchical multi-scale connectomes from multi-modal datasets, but solutions for EEG and MEG are still lacking. This project intents to extends Connectome Mapper 3 with an EEG connectome mapping pipeline.

#   details: "C-MARINeR is a focused sub-project MARINeR: Multivariate Analysis and Resampling Inference
#     for Neuroimaging in R. The C stands generally for connectivity, but specifically and statistically:
#     covariance or correlation. The C-MARINeR project aims to develop and distribute an R package and
#     ShinyApp. Together, R + Shiny allows for ease of use and, hopefully, simpler exploration of such
#     complex data, and quicker adoption of the techniques. <br> More info here:

#   details: "The three methods suggested above are just a starting point. If a group of participants wants to work
#     on something else, this is of course possible. We have also prepare some data to use the methods above,
#     but if you have your own data, please bring it with you and try to hack it with the methods presented."
