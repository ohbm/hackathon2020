#   details: "C-MARINeR is a focused sub-project MARINeR: Multivariate Analysis and Resampling Inference
#     for Neuroimaging in R. The C stands generally for connectivity, but specifically and statistically:
#     covariance or correlation. The C-MARINeR project aims to develop and distribute an R package and
#     ShinyApp. Together, R + Shiny allows for ease of use and, hopefully, simpler exploration of such
#     complex data, and quicker adoption of the techniques. <br> More info here:

#   details: "The three methods suggested above are just a starting point. If a group of participants wants to work
#     on something else, this is of course possible. We have also prepare some data to use the methods above,
